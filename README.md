# Tutorials & Sample Projects Using Solace PubSub+ Ansible Collection

Sample tutorials and projects that show the use of `ansible-solace` to configure [Solace PubSub+ Event Brokers](https://solace.com/products/event-broker/)
using the [Solace PubSub+ Ansible Collection](https://galaxy.ansible.com/solace/pubsub_plus).

For User Guides, Installation, and Reference Documentation, visit
[Solace PubSub+ Ansible Collection Documentation](https://solace-iot-team.github.io/ansible-solace-collection/).


**Tutorials** are examples to show the use of a particular module or set of modules.
They typically follow the naming convention: `working-with-{tutorial-name}`.

**Projects** are more complex examples usually derived from real-life use cases / projects and
implement one or more specific, repeatable integration patterns.

Most of the tutorials use Solace PubSub+ Standard - the free version - and pull it from docker hub.

Some of the projects / use case examples also require a Solace Cloud account to run fully.

Refer to the README in the project / tutorial for details.
